# ClassProjects
Every programming homework I am given in class
This includes the normal Object Oriented Programming class and the "Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures" shortened to IADS

If you are a classmate of mine you can use this, 
I don't mind, but remember to edit it first so it isn't so obvious.

I made this repository to just have my classwork(homework) saved, in case something happens to the one on my laptop.
